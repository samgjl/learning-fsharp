# Learning F#
## Purpose
- I want to learn some more [F#](https://fsharp.org/), as my job's language is in its evolutionary cousin.
- (The cousin is proprietary though, so shh...)
## Organization
- This repo is organized into days. This separation is just temporal, and I am not matching any specific schedule.
